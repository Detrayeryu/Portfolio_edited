               My name is Aden Tan and I am currently 16 Years old. I was from Bedok View Secondary School uptill 
               2020 when I moved to australia and attended Melba Copland Secondary School for a year.
                I like to play games during my free time and also have a background in sports.I took up athletics as a CCA ever since I was in primary school. I also take swimming lessons
                outside of school and was training for a lifesaver award until i had to move to Australia.

               I was from <a href="https://bedokviewsec.moe.edu.sg/" class="links" target="blank">Bedok View Secondary School</a> from 2017 - 2019. During 2020, I moved to Canberra Australia ACT to continue my 
               studies as my dad had a job there. In Australia, I attended a school called <a href="http://www.mcss.act.edu.au/" class="links" target="blank">Melba Copland Secondary School</a>. There, I was
               part of a program called the "<a href="http://www.mcss.act.edu.au/special_programs/headstart" class="links" target="blank">magellan program</a>". The magellan program is a program where Year 10 students like myself, 
               go to the college and take college subjects with the other Year 11 and 12 students. Over there, I took several different 
               subjects including English and literature, Y11 Specialist Math, Physics, Chemistry, Digital Technologies, Design and Emerging Technologies, PE and a Year 10 special 
               subject called <a href="http://www.mcss.act.edu.au/international_baccalaureate/personal_projects" class="links" target="">"Personal Projects"</a>.
               <br> 
               <br>
               Back in Singapore, I was in Bedok View Secondary School. There, I studied through Secondary 1 to Secondary 3. The 
               subjects i took include Emaths, Amaths, English, Pure Physics, Pure Chemistry, Combined Geography, Social studies and 
               Chinese.
               <br>
               <br>

               I would say that my strongest subject is maths. I have always been good at maths and even in Australia, I decided to take a math subject 1 grade above mine just so I dont fall short behind all my friends at math in Singapore.

                I was first introduced to Coding as a child when I was in Primary 6. I was introduced to the 
                software known as "scratch". I was fascinated by how you could make things move and react by "inputing" some "code". 
                I later found out that scratch was just a simplified version of what coding really is. When I reached Secondary 1, I 
                did more research into what coding is and raised my interest to dad. My father was supportive as I didnt 
                really have any interest besides gaming. My father than sent me on a C-sharp course to see let me experience it myself. 
                During the course, i learnt the basics of coding but there were some parts i wasn't quite sure yet. At the end of the 
                course i found out just how tiring and difficult coding really is. I took a break from coding for half a year. When i 
                was in Secondary 2, My father enrolled me into <a href="https://www.sgcodecampus.com/" class="links" target="blank">SGCodeCampus</a> to learn python. 
                I understood the course well and contiunue to take classes all the way to the end of 2019. In the 2 years, I have been 
                taught Python and HTML as well as CSS.

                In the year 2020, I became more active in coding. I had to stop my classes as I was in Australia. There, I started doing 
                free online courses on websites like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"class="links" target="blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog"class="links" target="blank">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"class="links" target="blank">HackerRank</a> and <a href="https://www.singtel.com/business/products-services/cybersecurity"class="links" target="blank">Singtel's Life Joureny Cyber security course</a>.
                I also started working on a discord bot for my <a href="#PP" class="links">"Personal Projects"</a>. I took part in several coding events including <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/programmes/sgcybertalent/sgcyberyouth/ycep"class="links" target="blank">YCEP 2020</a> 
                and <a href="https://www.austcyber.com/educate/competitions-and-challenges/cybertaipan"class="links" target="blank">CyberTaipan</a>.
